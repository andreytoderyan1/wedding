GOOGLE SHEETS STRUCTURE
=======================

Required Columns (in this exact order):

Column A: Name
- Full name of each guest
- Example: "John Smith", "Jane Smith", "Alice Smith"

Column B: Family ID  
- Unique identifier for each family
- All members of the same family must have the SAME Family ID
- Example: "SMITH", "JOHNSON", "FAMILY001"
- Case-sensitive (must match exactly)

Column C: Attending
- Leave empty initially (will be auto-filled by RSVP system)
- Will contain TRUE/FALSE after guests submit RSVPs
- Can also use checkboxes in Google Sheets

Column D: Submitted
- Leave empty initially (will be auto-filled by RSVP system)
- Will contain timestamp (date and time) when RSVP was submitted
- Example: "2025-01-15 14:30:00"
- Same timestamp for all family members in the same submission

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
------------------
Name          | Family ID | Attending | Submitted
--------------|-----------|-----------|----------
John Smith    | SMITH     |           | 
Jane Smith    | SMITH     |           | 
Alice Smith   | SMITH     |           | 
Bob Johnson   | JOHNSON   |           | 
Carol Johnson | JOHNSON   |           | 

IMPORTANT NOTES:
----------------
1. Column headers MUST be exactly: "Name", "Family ID", "Attending", "Submitted"
2. Family ID is case-sensitive - "SMITH" ≠ "smith"
3. All family members must have the SAME Family ID
4. Leave "Attending" and "Submitted" columns empty - they will be filled automatically
5. The "Submitted" column will show when the RSVP was submitted (same timestamp for all family members)
6. You can add more columns (like Email, Phone, etc.) but these 4 are required
